                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Llama-2 have become prevalent in real-world applications, exhibiting impressive text generation performance.LLMs are fundamentally developed from a scenario where the input data remains static and lacks a clear structure.To behave interactively over time, LLM-based chat systems must integrate additional contextual information (i.e., chat history) into their inputs, following a pre-defined structure.This paper identifies how such integration can expose LLMs to misleading context from untrusted sources and fail to differentiate between system and user inputs, allowing users to inject context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present a systematic methodology for conducting context injection attacks aimed at eliciting disallowed responses by introducing fabricated context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>This could lead to illegal actions, inappropriate content, or technology misuse.Our context fabrication strategies, acceptance elicitation and word anonymization, effectively create misleading contexts that can be structured with attacker-customized prompt templates, achieving injection through malicious user messages.Comprehensive evaluations on real-world LLMs such as ChatGPT and Llama-2 confirm the efficacy of the proposed attack with success rates reaching 97%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also discuss potential countermeasures that can be adopted for attack detection and developing more secure models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Our findings provide insights into the challenges associated with the real-world deployment of LLMs for interactive and structured data scenarios.</p>

                  <p>The smart grid represents a pivotal innovation in modernizing the electricity sector, offering an intelligent, digitalized energy network capable of optimizing energy delivery from source to consumer.It hence represents the backbone of the energy sector of a nation.Due to its central role, the availability of the smart grid is paramount and is hence necessary to have in-depth control of its operations and safety.To this aim, researchers developed multiple solutions to assess the smart grid's stability and guarantee that it operates in a safe state.Artificial intelligence and Machine learning algorithms have proven to be effective measures to accurately predict the smart grid's stability.Despite the presence of known adversarial attacks and potential solutions, currently, there exists no standardized measure to protect smart grids against this threat, leaving them open to new adversarial attacks.In this paper, we propose GAN-GRID a novel adversarial attack targeting the stability prediction system of a smart grid tailored to real-world constraints.Our findings reveal that an adversary armed solely with the stability model's output, devoid of data or model knowledge, can craft data classified as stable with an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 0.99.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Also by manipulating authentic data and sensor values, the attacker can amplify grid issues, potentially undetected due to a compromised stability prediction system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>These results underscore the imperative of fortifying smart grid security mechanisms against adversarial manipulation to uphold system stability and reliability.</p>

                  <p>In light of the widespread application of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, their security concerns have received much more attention than ever before, primarily due to the susceptibility of Deep Neural Networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous studies have illustrated that surreptitiously crafting adversarial perturbations enables the manipulation of speech recognition systems, resulting in the production of malicious commands. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>These attack methods mostly require adding noise perturbations under $\ell_p$ norm constraints, inevitably leaving behind artifacts of manual modifications.Recent research has alleviated this limitation by manipulating style vectors to synthesize adversarial examples based on Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis audio.However, style modifications based on optimization objectives significantly reduce the controllability and editability of audio styles.In this paper, we propose an attack on ASR systems based on user-customized style transfer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first test the effect of Style Transfer Attack (STA) which combines style transfer and adversarial attack in sequential order. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>And then, as an improvement, we propose an iterative Style Code Attack (SCA) to maintain audio quality.Experimental results show that our method can meet the need for user-customized styles and achieve a success rate of 82% in attacks, while keeping sound naturalness due to our user study.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown success in many natural language processing tasks.Despite rigorous safety alignment processes, supposedly safety-aligned LLMs like Llama 2 and Claude 2 are still susceptible to jailbreaks, leading to security risks and abuse of the models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>One option to mitigate such risks is to augment the LLM with a dedicated "safeguard", which checks the LLM's inputs or outputs for undesired behaviour. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>A promising approach is to use the LLM itself as the safeguard.Nonetheless, baseline methods, such as prompting the LLM to self-classify toxic content, demonstrate limited efficacy.We hypothesise that this is due to domain shift: the alignment training imparts a self-censoring behaviour to the model ("Sorry I can't do that"), while the self-classify approach shifts it to a classification format ("Is this prompt malicious").In this work, we propose PARDEN, which avoids this domain shift by simply asking the model to repeat its own outputs.PARDEN neither requires finetuning nor white box access to the model.We empirically verify the effectiveness of our method and show that PARDEN significantly outperforms existing jailbreak detection baselines for Llama-2 and Claude-2.Code and data are available at https://github.com/Ed-Zh/PARDEN.   We find that PARDEN is particularly powerful in the relevant regime of high True Positive Rate (TPR) and low False Positive Rate (FPR).For instance, for Llama2-7B, at TPR equal to 90%, PARDEN accomplishes a roughly 11x reduction in the FPR from 24.8% to 2.0% on the harmful behaviours dataset.</p>

                  <p>The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V has marked a significant step towards artificial general intelligence.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Existing methods mainly focus on aligning vision encoders with LLMs through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to endow LLMs with multimodal abilities, making MLLMs' inherent ability to react to multiple languages progressively deteriorate as the training process evolves. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.681</span></span>We empirically find that the imbalanced SFT datasets, primarily composed of English-centric image-text pairs, lead to significantly reduced performance in non-English languages.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>This is due to the failure of aligning the vision encoder and LLM with multilingual tokens during the SFT process. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.646</span></span>In this paper, we introduce Parrot, a novel method that utilizes textual guidance to drive visual token alignment at the language level.Parrot makes the visual tokens condition on diverse language inputs and uses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to promote the alignment of multilingual tokens.Specifically, to enhance non-English visual tokens alignment, we compute the cross-attention using the initial visual features and textual embeddings, the result of which is then fed into the MoE router to select the most relevant experts.The selected experts subsequently convert the initial visual tokens into language-specific visual tokens.Moreover, considering the current lack of benchmarks for evaluating multilingual capabilities within the field, we collect and make available a Massive Multilingual Multimodal Benchmark which includes 6 languages, 15 categories, and 12,000 questions, named as MMMB.Our method not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multilingual MMBench and MMMB, but also excels across a broad range of multimodal tasks.Both the source code and the training dataset of Parrot will be made publicly available.</p>
