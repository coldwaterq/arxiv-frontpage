                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Llama-2 have become prevalent in real-world applications, exhibiting impressive text generation performance.LLMs are fundamentally developed from a scenario where the input data remains static and lacks a clear structure.To behave interactively over time, LLM-based chat systems must integrate additional contextual information (i.e., chat history) into their inputs, following a pre-defined structure.This paper identifies how such integration can expose LLMs to misleading context from untrusted sources and fail to differentiate between system and user inputs, allowing users to inject context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present a systematic methodology for conducting context injection attacks aimed at eliciting disallowed responses by introducing fabricated context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>This could lead to illegal actions, inappropriate content, or technology misuse.Our context fabrication strategies, acceptance elicitation and word anonymization, effectively create misleading contexts that can be structured with attacker-customized prompt templates, achieving injection through malicious user messages.Comprehensive evaluations on real-world LLMs such as ChatGPT and Llama-2 confirm the efficacy of the proposed attack with success rates reaching 97%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also discuss potential countermeasures that can be adopted for attack detection and developing more secure models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Our findings provide insights into the challenges associated with the real-world deployment of LLMs for interactive and structured data scenarios.</p>

                  <p>The smart grid represents a pivotal innovation in modernizing the electricity sector, offering an intelligent, digitalized energy network capable of optimizing energy delivery from source to consumer.It hence represents the backbone of the energy sector of a nation.Due to its central role, the availability of the smart grid is paramount and is hence necessary to have in-depth control of its operations and safety.To this aim, researchers developed multiple solutions to assess the smart grid's stability and guarantee that it operates in a safe state.Artificial intelligence and Machine learning algorithms have proven to be effective measures to accurately predict the smart grid's stability.Despite the presence of known adversarial attacks and potential solutions, currently, there exists no standardized measure to protect smart grids against this threat, leaving them open to new adversarial attacks.In this paper, we propose GAN-GRID a novel adversarial attack targeting the stability prediction system of a smart grid tailored to real-world constraints.Our findings reveal that an adversary armed solely with the stability model's output, devoid of data or model knowledge, can craft data classified as stable with an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 0.99.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Also by manipulating authentic data and sensor values, the attacker can amplify grid issues, potentially undetected due to a compromised stability prediction system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>These results underscore the imperative of fortifying smart grid security mechanisms against adversarial manipulation to uphold system stability and reliability.</p>

                  <p>In light of the widespread application of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, their security concerns have received much more attention than ever before, primarily due to the susceptibility of Deep Neural Networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous studies have illustrated that surreptitiously crafting adversarial perturbations enables the manipulation of speech recognition systems, resulting in the production of malicious commands. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.612</span></span>These attack methods mostly require adding noise perturbations under $\ell_p$ norm constraints, inevitably leaving behind artifacts of manual modifications.Recent research has alleviated this limitation by manipulating style vectors to synthesize adversarial examples based on Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis audio.However, style modifications based on optimization objectives significantly reduce the controllability and editability of audio styles.In this paper, we propose an attack on ASR systems based on user-customized style transfer.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We first test the effect of Style Transfer Attack (STA) which combines style transfer and adversarial attack in sequential order. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span>And then, as an improvement, we propose an iterative Style Code Attack (SCA) to maintain audio quality.Experimental results show that our method can meet the need for user-customized styles and achieve a success rate of 82% in attacks, while keeping sound naturalness due to our user study.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown success in many natural language processing tasks.Despite rigorous safety alignment processes, supposedly safety-aligned LLMs like Llama 2 and Claude 2 are still susceptible to jailbreaks, leading to security risks and abuse of the models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>One option to mitigate such risks is to augment the LLM with a dedicated "safeguard", which checks the LLM's inputs or outputs for undesired behaviour. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>A promising approach is to use the LLM itself as the safeguard.Nonetheless, baseline methods, such as prompting the LLM to self-classify toxic content, demonstrate limited efficacy.We hypothesise that this is due to domain shift: the alignment training imparts a self-censoring behaviour to the model ("Sorry I can't do that"), while the self-classify approach shifts it to a classification format ("Is this prompt malicious").In this work, we propose PARDEN, which avoids this domain shift by simply asking the model to repeat its own outputs.PARDEN neither requires finetuning nor white box access to the model.We empirically verify the effectiveness of our method and show that PARDEN significantly outperforms existing jailbreak detection baselines for Llama-2 and Claude-2.Code and data are available at https://github.com/Ed-Zh/PARDEN.   We find that PARDEN is particularly powerful in the relevant regime of high True Positive Rate (TPR) and low False Positive Rate (FPR).For instance, for Llama2-7B, at TPR equal to 90%, PARDEN accomplishes a roughly 11x reduction in the FPR from 24.8% to 2.0% on the harmful behaviours dataset.</p>

                  <p>Photorealistic 3D reconstruction of street scenes is a critical technique for developing real-world simulators for autonomous driving.Despite the efficacy of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for driving scenes, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) emerges as a promising direction due to its faster speed and more explicit representation.However, most existing street 3DGS methods require tracked 3D vehicle bounding boxes to decompose the static and dynamic elements for effective reconstruction, limiting their applications for in-the-wild scenarios.To facilitate efficient 3D scene reconstruction without costly annotations, we propose a self-supervised street Gaussian ($\textit{S}^3$Gaussian) method to decompose dynamic and static elements from 4D consistency.We represent each scene with 3D Gaussians to preserve the explicitness and further accompany them with a spatial-temporal field network to compactly model the 4D dynamics.We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging Waymo-Open dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our method.Our $\textit{S}^3$Gaussian demonstrates the ability to decompose static and dynamic scenes and achieves the best performance without using 3D annotations.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code is available at: https://github.com/nnanhuang/S3Gaussian/. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span></p>

                  <p>3D generation has seen remarkable progress in recent years.Existing techniques, such as score distillation methods, produce notable results but require extensive per-scene optimization, impacting time efficiency.Alternatively, reconstruction-based approaches prioritize efficiency but compromise quality due to their limited handling of uncertainty.We introduce GECO, a novel method for high-quality 3D generative modeling that operates within a second.Our approach addresses the prevalent issues of uncertainty and inefficiency in current methods through a two-stage approach.In the initial stage, we train a single-step multi-view generative model with score distillation.Then, a second-stage distillation is applied to address the challenge of view inconsistency from the multi-view prediction.This two-stage process ensures a balanced approach to 3D generation, optimizing both quality and efficiency.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GECO achieves high-quality image-to-3D generation with an unprecedented level of efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span></p>

                  <p>Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) follow the paradigm that perceives visual information by aligning visual features with the input space of Large Language Models (LLMs), and concatenating visual tokens with text tokens to form a unified sequence input for LLMs.These methods demonstrate promising results on various vision-language tasks but are limited by the high computational effort due to the extended input sequence resulting from the involvement of visual tokens.In this paper, instead of input space alignment, we propose a novel parameter space alignment paradigm that represents visual information as model weights.For each input image, we use a vision encoder to extract visual features, convert features into perceptual weights, and merge the perceptual weights with LLM's weights.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this way, the input of LLM does not require visual tokens, which reduces the length of the input sequence and greatly improves efficiency. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.761</span></span>Following this paradigm, we propose VLoRA with the perceptual weights generator.The perceptual weights generator is designed to convert visual features to perceptual weights with low-rank property, exhibiting a form similar to LoRA.The experimental results show that our VLoRA achieves comparable performance on various benchmarks for MLLMs, while significantly reducing the computational costs for both training and inference.The code and models will be made open-source.</p>
