                  <p>Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting is to identify a wireless device from its uniqueness of the analog circuitry or hardware imperfections.However, unlike the MAC address which can be modified, such hardware feature is inevitable for the signal emitted to air, which can possibly reveal device whereabouts, e.g., a sniffer can use a pre-trained model to identify a nearby device when receiving its signal.Such fingerprint may expose critical private information, e.g., the associated upper-layer applications or the end-user.In this paper, we propose to erase such RF feature for wireless devices, which can prevent fingerprinting by actively perturbation from the signal perspective.Specifically, we consider a common RF fingerprinting scenario, where machine learning models are trained from pilot signal data for identification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A novel adversarial attack solution is designed to generate proper perturbations, whereby the perturbed pilot signal can hide the hardware feature and misclassify the model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>We theoretically show that the perturbation would not affect the communication function within a tolerable perturbation threshold.We also implement the pilot signal fingerprinting and the proposed perturbation process in a practical LTE system.Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the RF fingerprints can be effectively erased to protect the user privacy.</p>

                  <p><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this paper, we present the VideoLLaMA 2, a set of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) designed to enhance spatial-temporal modeling and audio understanding in video and audio-oriented tasks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.618</span></span>Building upon its predecessor, VideoLLaMA 2 incorporates a tailor-made Spatial-Temporal Convolution (STC) connector, which effectively captures the intricate spatial and temporal dynamics of video data.Additionally, we integrate an Audio Branch into the model through joint training, thereby enriching the multimodal understanding capabilities of the model by seamlessly incorporating audio cues.Comprehensive evaluations on multiple-choice video question answering (MC-VQA), open-ended video question answering (OE-VQA), and video captioning (VC) tasks demonstrate that VideoLLaMA 2 consistently achieves competitive results among open-source models and even gets close to some proprietary models on several benchmarks.Furthermore, VideoLLaMA 2 exhibits reasonable improvements in audio-only and audio-video question-answering (AQA & OE-AVQA) benchmarks over existing models.These advancements underline VideoLLaMA 2's superior performance in multimodal comprehension, setting a new standard for intelligent video analysis systems.All models are public to facilitate further research.</p>

                  <p>Image description datasets play a crucial role in the advancement of various applications such as image understanding, text-to-image generation, and text-image retrieval.Currently, image description datasets primarily originate from two sources.One source is the scraping of image-text pairs from the web.Despite their abundance, these descriptions are often of low quality and noisy.Another is through human labeling.Datasets such as COCO are generally very short and lack details.Although detailed image descriptions can be annotated by humans, the high annotation cost limits the feasibility.These limitations underscore the need for more efficient and scalable methods to generate accurate and detailed image descriptions.In this paper, we propose an innovative framework termed Image Textualization (IT), which automatically produces high-quality image descriptions by leveraging existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and multiple vision expert models in a collaborative manner, which maximally convert the visual information into text.To address the current lack of benchmarks for detailed descriptions, we propose several benchmarks for comprehensive evaluation, which verifies the quality of image descriptions created by our framework.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Furthermore, we show that LLaVA-7B, benefiting from training on IT-curated descriptions, acquire improved capability to generate richer image descriptions, substantially increasing the length and detail of their output with less hallucination. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.661</span></span></p>

                  <p>Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem.Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.639</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.</p>
