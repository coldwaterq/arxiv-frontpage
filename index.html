                  <p>The smart grid represents a pivotal innovation in modernizing the electricity sector, offering an intelligent, digitalized energy network capable of optimizing energy delivery from source to consumer.It hence represents the backbone of the energy sector of a nation.Due to its central role, the availability of the smart grid is paramount and is hence necessary to have in-depth control of its operations and safety.To this aim, researchers developed multiple solutions to assess the smart grid's stability and guarantee that it operates in a safe state.Artificial intelligence and Machine learning algorithms have proven to be effective measures to accurately predict the smart grid's stability.Despite the presence of known adversarial attacks and potential solutions, currently, there exists no standardized measure to protect smart grids against this threat, leaving them open to new adversarial attacks.In this paper, we propose GAN-GRID a novel adversarial attack targeting the stability prediction system of a smart grid tailored to real-world constraints.Our findings reveal that an adversary armed solely with the stability model's output, devoid of data or model knowledge, can craft data classified as stable with an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 0.99.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Also by manipulating authentic data and sensor values, the attacker can amplify grid issues, potentially undetected due to a compromised stability prediction system. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span>These results underscore the imperative of fortifying smart grid security mechanisms against adversarial manipulation to uphold system stability and reliability.</p>

                  <p>In light of the widespread application of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, their security concerns have received much more attention than ever before, primarily due to the susceptibility of Deep Neural Networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous studies have illustrated that surreptitiously crafting adversarial perturbations enables the manipulation of speech recognition systems, resulting in the production of malicious commands. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>These attack methods mostly require adding noise perturbations under $\ell_p$ norm constraints, inevitably leaving behind artifacts of manual modifications.Recent research has alleviated this limitation by manipulating style vectors to synthesize adversarial examples based on Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis audio.However, style modifications based on optimization objectives significantly reduce the controllability and editability of audio styles.In this paper, we propose an attack on ASR systems based on user-customized style transfer.We first test the effect of Style Transfer Attack (STA) which combines style transfer and adversarial attack in sequential order.And then, as an improvement, we propose an iterative Style Code Attack (SCA) to maintain audio quality.Experimental results show that our method can meet the need for user-customized styles and achieve a success rate of 82% in attacks, while keeping sound naturalness due to our user study.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown success in many natural language processing tasks.Despite rigorous safety alignment processes, supposedly safety-aligned LLMs like Llama 2 and Claude 2 are still susceptible to jailbreaks, leading to security risks and abuse of the models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>One option to mitigate such risks is to augment the LLM with a dedicated "safeguard", which checks the LLM's inputs or outputs for undesired behaviour. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>A promising approach is to use the LLM itself as the safeguard.Nonetheless, baseline methods, such as prompting the LLM to self-classify toxic content, demonstrate limited efficacy.We hypothesise that this is due to domain shift: the alignment training imparts a self-censoring behaviour to the model ("Sorry I can't do that"), while the self-classify approach shifts it to a classification format ("Is this prompt malicious").In this work, we propose PARDEN, which avoids this domain shift by simply asking the model to repeat its own outputs.PARDEN neither requires finetuning nor white box access to the model.We empirically verify the effectiveness of our method and show that PARDEN significantly outperforms existing jailbreak detection baselines for Llama-2 and Claude-2.Code and data are available at https://github.com/Ed-Zh/PARDEN.   We find that PARDEN is particularly powerful in the relevant regime of high True Positive Rate (TPR) and low False Positive Rate (FPR).For instance, for Llama2-7B, at TPR equal to 90%, PARDEN accomplishes a roughly 11x reduction in the FPR from 24.8% to 2.0% on the harmful behaviours dataset.</p>
