                  <p>Due to the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), recent works have focused on employing MLLM-based agents for autonomous driving in large-scale and dynamic environments.However, prevalent approaches often directly translate high-level instructions into low-level vehicle control signals, which deviates from the inherent language generation paradigm of MLLMs and fails to fully harness their emergent powers.As a result, the generalizability of these methods is highly restricted by autonomous driving datasets used during fine-tuning.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To tackle this challenge, we propose to connect high-level instructions and low-level control signals with mid-level language-driven commands, which are more fine-grained than high-level instructions but more universal and explainable than control signals, and thus can effectively bridge the gap in between. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.625</span></span>We implement this idea through a hierarchical multi-agent driving system named AD-H, including a MLLM planner for high-level reasoning and a lightweight controller for low-level execution.The hierarchical design liberates the MLLM from low-level control signal decoding and therefore fully releases their emergent capability in high-level perception, reasoning, and planning.We build a new dataset with action hierarchy annotations.Comprehensive closed-loop evaluations demonstrate several key advantages of our proposed AD-H system.First, AD-H can notably outperform state-of-the-art methods in achieving exceptional driving performance, even exhibiting self-correction capabilities during vehicle operation, a scenario not encountered in the training dataset.Second, AD-H demonstrates superior generalization under long-horizon instructions and novel environmental conditions, significantly surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.We will make our data and code publicly accessible at https://github.com/zhangzaibin/AD-H</p>
