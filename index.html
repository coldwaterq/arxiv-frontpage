                  <p>In light of the widespread application of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, their security concerns have received much more attention than ever before, primarily due to the susceptibility of Deep Neural Networks.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Previous studies have illustrated that surreptitiously crafting adversarial perturbations enables the manipulation of speech recognition systems, resulting in the production of malicious commands. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.607</span></span>These attack methods mostly require adding noise perturbations under $\ell_p$ norm constraints, inevitably leaving behind artifacts of manual modifications.Recent research has alleviated this limitation by manipulating style vectors to synthesize adversarial examples based on Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis audio.However, style modifications based on optimization objectives significantly reduce the controllability and editability of audio styles.In this paper, we propose an attack on ASR systems based on user-customized style transfer.We first test the effect of Style Transfer Attack (STA) which combines style transfer and adversarial attack in sequential order.And then, as an improvement, we propose an iterative Style Code Attack (SCA) to maintain audio quality.Experimental results show that our method can meet the need for user-customized styles and achieve a success rate of 82% in attacks, while keeping sound naturalness due to our user study.</p>

                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown success in many natural language processing tasks.Despite rigorous safety alignment processes, supposedly safety-aligned LLMs like Llama 2 and Claude 2 are still susceptible to jailbreaks, leading to security risks and abuse of the models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>One option to mitigate such risks is to augment the LLM with a dedicated "safeguard", which checks the LLM's inputs or outputs for undesired behaviour. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.609</span></span>A promising approach is to use the LLM itself as the safeguard.Nonetheless, baseline methods, such as prompting the LLM to self-classify toxic content, demonstrate limited efficacy.We hypothesise that this is due to domain shift: the alignment training imparts a self-censoring behaviour to the model ("Sorry I can't do that"), while the self-classify approach shifts it to a classification format ("Is this prompt malicious").In this work, we propose PARDEN, which avoids this domain shift by simply asking the model to repeat its own outputs.PARDEN neither requires finetuning nor white box access to the model.We empirically verify the effectiveness of our method and show that PARDEN significantly outperforms existing jailbreak detection baselines for Llama-2 and Claude-2.Code and data are available at https://github.com/Ed-Zh/PARDEN.   We find that PARDEN is particularly powerful in the relevant regime of high True Positive Rate (TPR) and low False Positive Rate (FPR).For instance, for Llama2-7B, at TPR equal to 90%, PARDEN accomplishes a roughly 11x reduction in the FPR from 24.8% to 2.0% on the harmful behaviours dataset.</p>

                  <p>Digital watermarking is the process of embedding secret information by altering images in a way that is undetectable to the human eye.To increase the robustness of the model, many deep learning-based watermarking methods use the encoder-decoder architecture by adding different noises to the noise layer.The decoder then extracts the watermarked information from the distorted image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, this method can only resist weak noise attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.632</span></span>To improve the robustness of the algorithm against stronger noise, this paper proposes to introduce a denoise module between the noise layer and the decoder.The module is aimed at reducing noise and recovering some of the information lost during an attack.Additionally, the paper introduces the SE module to fuse the watermarking information pixel-wise and channel dimensions-wise, improving the encoder's efficiency.Experimental results show that our proposed method is comparable to existing models and outperforms state-of-the-art under different noise intensities.In addition, ablation experiments show the superiority of our proposed module.</p>

                  <p>Scientific document summarization has been a challenging task due to the long structure of the input text.The long input hinders the simultaneous effective modeling of both global high-order relations between sentences and local intra-sentence relations which is the most critical step in extractive summarization.However, existing methods mostly focus on one type of relation, neglecting the simultaneous effective modeling of both relations, which can lead to insufficient learning of semantic representations.In this paper, we propose HAESum, a novel approach utilizing graph neural networks to locally and globally model documents based on their hierarchical discourse structure.First, intra-sentence relations are learned using a local heterogeneous graph.Subsequently, a novel hypergraph self-attention layer is introduced to further enhance the characterization of high-order inter-sentence relations.We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HAESum and the importance of considering hierarchical structures in modeling long scientific documents.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our code will be available at \url{https://github.com/MoLICHENXI/HAESum} <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.603</span></span></p>

                  <p>Facts extraction is pivotal for constructing knowledge graphs.Recently, the increasing demand for temporal facts in downstream tasks has led to the emergence of the task of temporal fact extraction.In this paper, we specifically address the extraction of temporal facts from natural language text.Previous studies fail to handle the challenge of establishing time-to-fact correspondences in complex sentences.To overcome this hurdle, we propose a timeline-based sentence decomposition strategy using large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning, ensuring a fine-grained understanding of the timeline associated with various facts.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In addition, we evaluate the performance of LLMs for direct temporal fact extraction and get unsatisfactory results. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.678</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>To this end, we introduce TSDRE, a method that incorporates the decomposition capabilities of LLMs into the traditional fine-tuning of smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs). <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.644</span></span>To support the evaluation, we construct ComplexTRED, a complex temporal fact extraction dataset.Our experiments show that TSDRE achieves state-of-the-art results on both HyperRED-Temporal and ComplexTRED datasets.</p>

                  <p>Well-structured transition systems (WSTS) are an abstract family of systems that encompasses a vast landscape of infinite-state systems.By requiring a well-quasi-ordering (wqo) on the set of states, a WSTS enables generic algorithms for classic verification tasks such as coverability and termination.However, even for systems that are WSTS like vector addition systems (VAS), the framework is notoriously ill-equipped to analyse reachability (as opposed to coverability).Moreover, some important types of infinite-state systems fall out of WSTS' scope entirely, such as pushdown systems (PDS).   Inspired by recent algorithmic techniques on VAS, we propose an abstract notion of systems where the set of runs is equipped with a wqo and supports amalgamation of runs.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We show that it subsumes a large class of infinite-state systems, including (reachability languages of) VAS and PDS, and even all systems from the abstract framework of valence systems, except for those already known to be Turing-complete.    <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.619</span></span>Moreover, this abstract setting enables simple and general algorithmic solutions to unboundedness problems, which have received much attention in recent years.We present algorithms for the (i) simultaneous unboundedness problem (which implies computability of downward closures and decidability of separability by piecewise testable languages), (ii) computing priority downward closures, (iii) deciding whether a language is bounded, meaning included in $w_1^*\cdots w_k^*$ for some words $w_1,\ldots,w_k$, and (iv)~effective regularity of unary languages.This leads to either drastically simpler proofs or new decidability results for a rich variety of systems.</p>

                  <p>The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has profoundly impacted human society, driving significant advancements in multiple sectors.Yet, the escalating demands on AI have highlighted the limitations of AI's current offerings, catalyzing a movement towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).AGI, distinguished by its ability to execute diverse real-world tasks with efficiency and effectiveness comparable to human intelligence, reflects a paramount milestone in AI evolution.While existing works have summarized specific recent advancements of AI, they lack a comprehensive discussion of AGI's definitions, goals, and developmental trajectories.Different from existing survey papers, this paper delves into the pivotal questions of our proximity to AGI and the strategies necessary for its realization through extensive surveys, discussions, and original perspectives.We start by articulating the requisite capability frameworks for AGI, integrating the internal, interface, and system dimensions.As the realization of AGI requires more advanced capabilities and adherence to stringent constraints, we further discuss necessary AGI alignment technologies to harmonize these factors.Notably, we emphasize the importance of approaching AGI responsibly by first defining the key levels of AGI progression, followed by the evaluation framework that situates the status-quo, and finally giving our roadmap of how to reach the pinnacle of AGI.Moreover, to give tangible insights into the ubiquitous impact of the integration of AI, we outline existing challenges and potential pathways toward AGI in multiple domains.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>In sum, serving as a pioneering exploration into the current state and future trajectory of AGI, this paper aims to foster a collective comprehension and catalyze broader public discussions among researchers and practitioners on AGI. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.6</span></span></p>

                  <p>Vector graphics are widely used in digital art and highly favored by designers due to their scalability and layer-wise properties.However, the process of creating and editing vector graphics requires creativity and design expertise, making it a time-consuming task.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Recent advancements in text-to-vector (T2V) generation have aimed to make this process more accessible. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.604</span></span>However, existing T2V methods directly optimize control points of vector graphics paths, often resulting in intersecting or jagged paths due to the lack of geometry constraints.To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel neural path representation by designing a dual-branch Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that learns the path latent space from both sequence and image modalities.By optimizing the combination of neural paths, we can incorporate geometric constraints while preserving expressivity in generated SVGs.Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage path optimization method to improve the visual and topological quality of generated SVGs.In the first stage, a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model guides the initial generation of complex vector graphics through the Variational Score Distillation (VSD) process.In the second stage, we refine the graphics using a layer-wise image vectorization strategy to achieve clearer elements and structure.We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments and showcase various applications.The project page is https://intchous.github.io/T2V-NPR.</p>
