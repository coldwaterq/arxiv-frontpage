                  <p>The ability to learn compact, high-quality, and easy-to-optimize representations for visual data is paramount to many applications such as novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction.Recent work has shown substantial success in using tensor networks to design such compact and high-quality representations.However, the ability to optimize tensor-based representations, and in particular, the highly compact tensor train representation, is still lacking.This has prevented practitioners from deploying the full potential of tensor networks for visual data.To this end, we propose 'Prolongation Upsampling Tensor Train (PuTT)', a novel method for learning tensor train representations in a coarse-to-fine manner.Our method involves the prolonging or `upsampling' of a learned tensor train representation, creating a sequence of 'coarse-to-fine' tensor trains that are incrementally refined.We evaluate our representation along three axes: (1).compression, (2).denoising capability, and (3).image completion capability.To assess these axes, we consider the tasks of image fitting, 3D fitting, and novel view synthesis, where our method shows an improved performance compared to state-of-the-art tensor-based methods.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>For full results see our project webpage: https://sebulo.github.io/PuTT_website/ <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.616</span></span></p>

                  <p>Most large multimodal models (LMMs) are implemented by feeding visual tokens as a sequence into the first layer of a large language model (LLM).The resulting architecture is simple but significantly increases computation and memory costs, as it has to handle a large number of additional tokens in its input layer.This paper presents a new architecture DeepStack for LMMs.Considering $N$ layers in the language and vision transformer of LMMs, we stack the visual tokens into $N$ groups and feed each group to its aligned transformer layer \textit{from bottom to top}.Surprisingly, this simple method greatly enhances the power of LMMs to model interactions among visual tokens across layers but with minimal additional cost.We apply DeepStack to both language and vision transformer in LMMs, and validate the effectiveness of DeepStack LMMs with extensive empirical results.Using the same context length, our DeepStack 7B and 13B parameters surpass their counterparts by \textbf{2.7} and \textbf{2.9} on average across \textbf{9} benchmarks, respectively.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Using only one-fifth of the context length, DeepStack rivals closely to the counterparts that use the full context length. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>These gains are particularly pronounced on high-resolution tasks, e.g., \textbf{4.2}, \textbf{11.0}, and \textbf{4.0} improvements on TextVQA, DocVQA, and InfoVQA compared to LLaVA-1.5-7B, respectively.We further apply DeepStack to vision transformer layers, which brings us a similar amount of improvements, \textbf{3.8} on average compared with LLaVA-1.5-7B.</p>

                  <p>Incorporating spectral information to enhance Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown promising results but raises a fundamental challenge due to the inherent ambiguity of eigenvectors.Various architectures have been proposed to address this ambiguity, referred to as spectral invariant architectures.Notable examples include GNNs and Graph Transformers that use spectral distances, spectral projection matrices, or other invariant spectral features.However, the potential expressive power of these spectral invariant architectures remains largely unclear.The goal of this work is to gain a deep theoretical understanding of the expressive power obtainable when using spectral features.We first introduce a unified message-passing framework for designing spectral invariant GNNs, called Eigenspace Projection GNN (EPNN).A comprehensive analysis shows that EPNN essentially unifies all prior spectral invariant architectures, in that they are either strictly less expressive or equivalent to EPNN.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A fine-grained expressiveness hierarchy among different architectures is also established. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.627</span></span>On the other hand, we prove that EPNN itself is bounded by a recently proposed class of Subgraph GNNs, implying that all these spectral invariant architectures are strictly less expressive than 3-WL.Finally, we discuss whether using spectral features can gain additional expressiveness when combined with more expressive GNNs.</p>
