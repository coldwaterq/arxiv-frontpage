                  <p>Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting is to identify a wireless device from its uniqueness of the analog circuitry or hardware imperfections.However, unlike the MAC address which can be modified, such hardware feature is inevitable for the signal emitted to air, which can possibly reveal device whereabouts, e.g., a sniffer can use a pre-trained model to identify a nearby device when receiving its signal.Such fingerprint may expose critical private information, e.g., the associated upper-layer applications or the end-user.In this paper, we propose to erase such RF feature for wireless devices, which can prevent fingerprinting by actively perturbation from the signal perspective.Specifically, we consider a common RF fingerprinting scenario, where machine learning models are trained from pilot signal data for identification.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>A novel adversarial attack solution is designed to generate proper perturbations, whereby the perturbed pilot signal can hide the hardware feature and misclassify the model. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.624</span></span>We theoretically show that the perturbation would not affect the communication function within a tolerable perturbation threshold.We also implement the pilot signal fingerprinting and the proposed perturbation process in a practical LTE system.Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the RF fingerprints can be effectively erased to protect the user privacy.</p>

                  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Llama-2 have become prevalent in real-world applications, exhibiting impressive text generation performance.LLMs are fundamentally developed from a scenario where the input data remains static and lacks a clear structure.To behave interactively over time, LLM-based chat systems must integrate additional contextual information (i.e., chat history) into their inputs, following a pre-defined structure.This paper identifies how such integration can expose LLMs to misleading context from untrusted sources and fail to differentiate between system and user inputs, allowing users to inject context.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We present a systematic methodology for conducting context injection attacks aimed at eliciting disallowed responses by introducing fabricated context. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.635</span></span>This could lead to illegal actions, inappropriate content, or technology misuse.Our context fabrication strategies, acceptance elicitation and word anonymization, effectively create misleading contexts that can be structured with attacker-customized prompt templates, achieving injection through malicious user messages.Comprehensive evaluations on real-world LLMs such as ChatGPT and Llama-2 confirm the efficacy of the proposed attack with success rates reaching 97%.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We also discuss potential countermeasures that can be adopted for attack detection and developing more secure models. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.602</span></span>Our findings provide insights into the challenges associated with the real-world deployment of LLMs for interactive and structured data scenarios.</p>

                  <p>In this paper, we study the role of initialization in Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as originally introduced in Hu et al. (2021).Essentially, to start from the pretrained model as initialization for finetuning, one can either initialize B to zero and A to random (default initialization in PEFT package), or vice-versa.In both cases, the product BA is equal to zero at initialization, which makes finetuning starts from the pretrained model.These two initialization schemes are seemingly similar.They should in-principle yield the same performance and share the same optimal learning rate.We demonstrate that this is an incorrect intuition and that the first scheme (initializing B to zero and A to random) on average yields better performance compared to the other scheme.Our theoretical analysis shows that the reason behind this might be that the first initialization allows the use of larger learning rates (without causing output instability) compared to the second initialization, resulting in more efficient learning of the first scheme.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>We validate our results with extensive experiments on LLMs. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.806</span></span></p>

                  <p>Web-crawled image-text pairs are inherently noisy.Prior studies demonstrate that semantically aligning and enriching textual descriptions of these pairs can significantly enhance model training across various vision-language tasks, particularly text-to-image generation.However, large-scale investigations in this area remain predominantly closed-source.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our paper aims to bridge this community effort, leveraging the powerful and \textit{open-sourced} LLaMA-3, a GPT-4 level LLM. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.752</span></span><span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Our recaptioning pipeline is simple: first, we fine-tune a LLaMA-3-8B powered LLaVA-1.5 and then employ it to recaption 1.3 billion images from the DataComp-1B dataset. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.665</span></span>Our empirical results confirm that this enhanced dataset, Recap-DataComp-1B, offers substantial benefits in training advanced vision-language models.For discriminative models like CLIP, we observe enhanced zero-shot performance in cross-modal retrieval tasks.For generative models like text-to-image Diffusion Transformers, the generated images exhibit a significant improvement in alignment with users' text instructions, especially in following complex queries.Our project page is https://www.haqtu.me/Recap-Datacomp-1B/</p>
