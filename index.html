                  <p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown success in many natural language processing tasks.Despite rigorous safety alignment processes, supposedly safety-aligned LLMs like Llama 2 and Claude 2 are still susceptible to jailbreaks, leading to security risks and abuse of the models.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>One option to mitigate such risks is to augment the LLM with a dedicated "safeguard", which checks the LLM's inputs or outputs for undesired behaviour. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.621</span></span>A promising approach is to use the LLM itself as the safeguard.Nonetheless, baseline methods, such as prompting the LLM to self-classify toxic content, demonstrate limited efficacy.We hypothesise that this is due to domain shift: the alignment training imparts a self-censoring behaviour to the model ("Sorry I can't do that"), while the self-classify approach shifts it to a classification format ("Is this prompt malicious").In this work, we propose PARDEN, which avoids this domain shift by simply asking the model to repeat its own outputs.PARDEN neither requires finetuning nor white box access to the model.We empirically verify the effectiveness of our method and show that PARDEN significantly outperforms existing jailbreak detection baselines for Llama-2 and Claude-2.Code and data are available at https://github.com/Ed-Zh/PARDEN.   We find that PARDEN is particularly powerful in the relevant regime of high True Positive Rate (TPR) and low False Positive Rate (FPR).For instance, for Llama2-7B, at TPR equal to 90%, PARDEN accomplishes a roughly 11x reduction in the FPR from 24.8% to 2.0% on the harmful behaviours dataset.</p>

                  <p>Digital watermarking is the process of embedding secret information by altering images in a way that is undetectable to the human eye.To increase the robustness of the model, many deep learning-based watermarking methods use the encoder-decoder architecture by adding different noises to the noise layer.The decoder then extracts the watermarked information from the distorted image.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>However, this method can only resist weak noise attacks. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.631</span></span>To improve the robustness of the algorithm against stronger noise, this paper proposes to introduce a denoise module between the noise layer and the decoder.The module is aimed at reducing noise and recovering some of the information lost during an attack.Additionally, the paper introduces the SE module to fuse the watermarking information pixel-wise and channel dimensions-wise, improving the encoder's efficiency.Experimental results show that our proposed method is comparable to existing models and outperforms state-of-the-art under different noise intensities.In addition, ablation experiments show the superiority of our proposed module.</p>

                  <p>Many online hate groups exist to disparage others based on race, gender identity, sex, or other characteristics.The accessibility of these communities allows users to join multiple types of hate groups (e.g., a racist community and misogynistic community), which calls into question whether these peripatetic users could be further radicalized compared to users that stay in one type of hate group.However, little is known about the dynamics of joining multiple types of hate groups, nor the effect of these groups on peripatetic users.In this paper, we develop a new method to classify hate subreddits, and the identities they disparage, which we use to better understand how users become peripatetic (join different types of hate subreddits).<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>The hate classification technique utilizes human-validated LLMs to extract the protected identities attacked, if any, across 168 subreddits. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.696</span></span>We then cluster identity-attacking subreddits to discover three broad categories of hate: racist, anti-LGBTQ, and misogynistic.We show that becoming active in a user's first hate subreddit can cause them to become active in additional hate subreddits of a different category.We also find that users who join additional hate subreddits, especially of a different category, become more active in hate subreddits as a whole and develop a wider hate group lexicon.We are therefore motivated to train an AI model that we find usefully predicts the hate categories users will become active in based on post text read and written.The accuracy of this model may be partly driven by peripatetic users often using the language of hate subreddits they eventually join.Overall, these results highlight the unique risks associated with hate communities on a social media platform, as discussion of alternative targets of hate may lead users to target more protected identities.</p>

                  <p>3D object detection aims to recover the 3D information of concerning objects and serves as the fundamental task of autonomous driving perception.Its performance greatly depends on the scale of labeled training data, yet it is costly to obtain high-quality annotations for point cloud data.While conventional methods focus on generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples as supplements for training, the structural nature of 3D point cloud data facilitates the composition of objects and backgrounds to synthesize realistic scenes.Motivated by this, we propose a hardness-aware scene synthesis (HASS) method to generate adaptive synthetic scenes to improve the generalization of the detection models.We obtain pseudo-labels for unlabeled objects and generate diverse scenes with different compositions of objects and backgrounds.As the scene synthesis is sensitive to the quality of pseudo-labels, we further propose a hardness-aware strategy to reduce the effect of low-quality pseudo-labels and maintain a dynamic pseudo-database to ensure the diversity and quality of synthetic scenes.Extensive experimental results on the widely used KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HASS method, which outperforms existing semi-supervised learning methods on 3D object detection.<span class='px-1 mx-1 bg-yellow-200'>Code: https://github.com/wzzheng/HASS. <span style='font-size: 0.65rem;' class='text-purple-500 font-bold'>0.605</span></span></p>
